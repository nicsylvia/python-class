# 7. Create a sub-class called MyMathSubCLass 
# a. Use the “import” keyword to import the “MyMathClass”
# b. Make sure “MyMathSubClass” inherits “MyMathClass”
# c. Create two methods in this child class
# i. Make sure that this new method can inherit all the codes on the parent class by testing them 
# out.
# ii. The first method will generate a multiplication of any number, there should be default values 
# for multiplyer and stop values
# iii. The second method will be a nested multiplication that will generate multiplication table from 2
# X 1 to 12 X 1
